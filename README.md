# Python_Climate
This code is similar to the work that I did in R. I worked with the same data and performed a similar analysis. 
However, I took this one a bit further and looked at how the temperature of the states located in the NW part of the US are changing
compared to the US as a whole. From the analysis it appears that the NW is warming quite a bit faster than the US as a whole is. 
This is important because those of us located directly on the coast tend not to have A/C due to the historically mild temperatures.
With temperatures here rising this quickly, will we begin to see more frequent and severe heat stints? We saw one in 2021. 

As with the R repository, this dataset originated here: https://www.kaggle.com/berkeleyearth/climate-change-earth-surface-temperature-data and I took some inspiration for the first part of the code from this coder here: https://www.kaggle.com/aparnachoudhuri/time-series-analysis-of-climate-change-data-set.
